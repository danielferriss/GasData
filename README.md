List of Assumptions and objectives
1. In practice the Fleet Fuel Purchasing cards are kept in the vehicles and drives making the purchase are not known.   Because we cannot Identify fuel Purcahases down to Individual Drivers we are using the VehicleID as a Proxy for the Driver.
2. Some vehicles are used almost continously and the driver of the vehicle may change many times throught the day.  We are not able to control for this in the presentation or in the competetive portions of the application
3. Data was aggretaged to the week for most visuals and compititions.   If a Fuel purchase was not made each week that Vehicle ID was not imcluded in the compition for that week
4. Driving Less miles is desireable
5. Driving the vehicle so that it is more fuel efficient is desireable

6. Showing driving data to City drivers may help them to understand the importance of acurate data entry (at the point of sale odomoter reaading )
7. Watching the Fuel Efficiency of individual Vehilces overtime could alert fleet managers of maintenance issues. Such as tire inflation, oil changes, Etc..
8. Mining  Fuel price data  could save the city money by identifying gas stations that statisticly have the lowest prices.
9.
